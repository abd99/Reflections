When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working with a team or when I want to share my work online


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if it is done automatically, we might face a problem while in the middle of working on something important.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are online copies of a repository in GitHub, clones are copies of repository from GitHub to machine or from machine to machine and branches are copies of a repository used to work separately on a different feature.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline and it saves a lot of data overhead when pushing changes to github and it gives the possibility to do a quick check which changes are made in the online repo compared to the offline repository.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would use e-mails and dropbox. It would be simpler to send as I don't have to learn Git and it would be difficult to maintain different versions.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I want to add a new feature and I'm not sure whether it'll work fine and I want to keep things separate. Using separate branches makes the master stay cleaner but at the same time it is difficult to merge changes.
