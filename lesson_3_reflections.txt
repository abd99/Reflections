When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working with a team or when I want to share my work online


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if it is done automatically, we might face a problem while in the middle of working on something important.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are online copies of a repository in GitHub, clones are copies of repository from GitHub to machine or from machine to machine and branches are copies of a repository used to work separately on a different feature.
