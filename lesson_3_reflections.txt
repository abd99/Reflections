When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working with a team or when I want to share my work online


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if it is done automatically, we might face a problem while in the middle of working on something important.
