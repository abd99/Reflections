It helped me quite a lot. It made the work a whole lot easier.

It makes finding right where the changes were made a lot easier.

It will help me revert back to a working version in case any change in the code messes up my entire code

Pros:
1. Helps choose when to commit.
2. Committing only when there are logical changes is easier.

Cons:
1. Bad if I forget to commit.

Saving related files together will help a lot in coding projects.

git log displays commit id along with commit message and date and time.
git diff 1stfile 2ndfile displays difference between those files.

Using version control will make me fearless about trying new changes in my app.

I want to try using git for Android Development
