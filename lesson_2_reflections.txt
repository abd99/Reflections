What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a new local directory. We need it to add version control to our code/file.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think staging area contains files that to be included in the next commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By comparing it to the previous commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When we try new features which we aren't sure about and maybe a new category/theme. Branches would help in trying out these changes without any fear and at the same time keeping the master i.e the main file intact.
